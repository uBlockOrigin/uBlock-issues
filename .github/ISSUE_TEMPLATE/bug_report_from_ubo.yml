        Speculated performance issues will be marked as invalid and closed if they do not come with actual profiling data + fully substantiated analysis supporting the claim.
        No new filter list requests are permitted. Such issues will be declined and closed.

        To rule out invalid issues, confirm and check each one of the checkboxes.
        If [disabling uBO](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Quick-guide:-popup-user-interface#the-large-power-button) makes the issue go away, then it is a filter issue.
        See what [the logger](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/The-logger) reports when you reproduce the issue, this will help you determine whether this is a filter issue.
        If the issue is still present after disabling uBO in the browser, it is unrelated to uBO.
