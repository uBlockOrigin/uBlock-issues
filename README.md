# uBlock-issues

This is the official community-maintained [issue tracker for uBlock Origin](https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uBlock-issues/issues). **Do not post any filter list issues or issues where website's functionality is broken.** We have [uAssets issue tracker](https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets/issues) for that, post there instead. 

**Speculated performance issues will be marked as invalid and closed if they do not come with actual profiling data from [Firefox Profiler](https://profiler.firefox.com/)/[Chromium Profiler](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/profiles) + fully substantiated analysis supporting the claim.**

**Issues specific to uBlock-legacy variant should be filed at https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock-for-firefox-legacy/issues**

**Opening issues for adding new filter lists is now disallowed and such issues will be declined and closed.**

**Support issues and questions are handled at [/r/uBlockOrigin](https://old.reddit.com/r/uBlockOrigin/).**

uBlock-issues is also used for the draft version of the wiki.

# uBO-dev-builds

You can help with the development of uBlock Origin by using the development build, in order to report new issues or regression bugs before stable releases of uBlock Origin are published.

Development builds:
- **Chromium**: install from <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin-development/cgbcahbpdhpcegmbfconppldiemgcoii>
- **Firefox**: click the most recent `uBlock0_[version].firefox.signed.xpi` file from <https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/releases>
- **Thunderbird**: download the `uBlock0_[version].thunderbird.xpi` package from <https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/releases>, then drag-n-drop it into Thunderbird's Add-ons Manager pane (Thunderbird 65+ required)

If you install a development build once, it will be automatically updated with a more recent development build version when a new one is published.

# Chromium/Chrome 49 users

Minimum version for Chromium/Chrome was bumped to v55, hence no longer compatible for this browser version. Users who would still like to install uBO can download v1.16.18 (last working version) from the [releases](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/releases/tag/1.16.18) section of uBO repository and install it by unpacking and loading it via Developer Mode.
