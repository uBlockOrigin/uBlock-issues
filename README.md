Report issues specific to the Manifest Version 3 (MV3) variant in the [uBOL issue tracker](https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uBOL-issues/issues).

#### Performance Issues

Speculated performance issues are marked as invalid and closed if they do not come with actual profiling data from the [Firefox Profiler](https://profiler.firefox.com/) (or [Firefox Profiler for Chromium](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/firefox-profiler/ljmahpnflmbkgaipnfbpgjipcnahlghn)) and a fully substantiated analysis supporting the claim.

#### WebRTC Issues

Do not open issues about WebRTC leaking local IP addresses. Supported modern browsers do not cause undue local IP address leaks through WebRTC. uBO is not a VPN/proxy tool. If you are experiencing such an issue, report it to the browser or VPN/proxy tools software provider or, if needed, both.

#### Filter List Requests

New filter list requests are not permitted and will be declined and closed.
