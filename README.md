# uBlock-issues

This is the official community-maintained [issue tracker for uBlock Origin](https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uBlock-issues/issues). Do not post any filter list issues or issues where website's functionality is broken. We have [uAssets issue tracker](https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets/issues) for that, post there instead. Speculated performance issues will be marked as invalid and closed if they do not come with actual profiling data + analysis supporting the claim.

Opening issues for adding new filter lists is now disallowed and such issues will be declined and closed.

Support issues and questions are handled at [/r/uBlockOrigin](https://old.reddit.com/r/uBlockOrigin/)

You can help the development of uBlock Origin by using the development build, in order to report new issues or regression bugs before stable releases of uBlock Origin are published.

Development builds:
- Chromium-based browsers: <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin-development/cgbcahbpdhpcegmbfconppldiemgcoii>
- Firefox: click the most recent `uBlock0.firefox.signed.xpi` file from <https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/releases>

If you install a development build once, it will be automatically updated with a more recent development build version when a new one is published.

# Chromium/Chrome 49 users

Minimum version for Chromium/Chrome was bumped to v51, hence no longer compatible for this browser version. Users who would still like to install uBO can download v1.16.18 (last working version) from the [releases](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/releases/tag/1.16.18) section of uBO repo and install it by unpacking and loading it via Developer Mode.
